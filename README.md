# PiedraPapelTijera
Juego de piedra, papel y tijera con fondo din√°mico creado con javascript
This is a task created to make a Stone, Paper and Scissors game but whit an animated background and the respective bottons only using
html, css and javascript code.
The answers showed in each prompt need to be improved.
I had some troubles with the execution but i found the answer analyzing the local scope and the universal scope and building a
function by each botton.
